I.Research and make notes on the following topics:

1)Why is pandas loved by the analytics community?
	i) Data representation - helps to analyze and understand data better
	ii)Less writing and more work done - Pandas helps to shorten the procedure of handling data. With the time saved, we can focus more on data analysis algorithms.
	iii)An extensive set of features - They provide you with a huge set of important commands and features which are used to easily analyze your data.
	iv)Efficiently handles large data - Easy to handl large data
	v)Makes data flexible and customizable  Pandas provide a huge feature set to apply on the data you have so that you can customize, edit and pivot it 

2)What are Dataframes?
	A DataFrame is a data structure that organizes data into a 2-dimensional table of rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet.

3)Pandas File Input / Output

4)Pandas built in functions ?
	data2 = pd.DataFrame(weather_data)
	df.describe()
	df.describe(include = 'all')
	data = pd.DataFrame(weather_data,columns = ['date','temperature','wind_speed(in kmph)','type_of_weather'])
	df = pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="/content/ADANIPORTS.csv")
	df.shape
	df.head
	df.tail
	df[0:6:2] OR df[-1:-10:-2](Slicing [start:end:step]
	df.info()
	df.isnull()
	df.isnull().sum()
	df.columns
	df.count()
	df.value_count()
	df.Symbol.value_counts() -- Symbol is a feature
	df.dtypes
	df["Open"].max()
	df['Open'].min()
	df[df['Open']==df['Open'].min()]


5)What are pandas built?
	Pandas is built on top of two core Python libraries—matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. 


6)Slicing with Pandas ?

	a))How to retrieve a column value from a Dataframe
	i)based on integer-location indexing (iloc) 
	ii)based on the label indexing (loc).
		To retrieve the first column value (eg: df.iloc[0].col1)
		To retrieve the last column value: (eg :df.iloc[-1].col1)
		To retrieve a column value with the label(df.loc[1, “col1”])
	

7)How to do Data Inconstancy Check with pandas ?
	-> Check the dtype of the features 
	-> Ifthe dtypes are marked wrong, do a conversion

8)How to Check for Null values ?
	df.isnull()
	df.isnull().sum()

9)How to Check for duplicate values?
	print(data.duplicated())
	data[data.duplicated() == True]

10)Data Cleaning with Pandas

	Dropping Columns/row in a DataFrame
	Changing the Index of a DataFrame
	Tidying up Fields in the Data
	Validating the duplicates 
	finding null values
	Renaming Columns and Skipping Rows
