1. Learn about Probability distribution.
	A probability distribution is represented in the form of a table or an equation. The table or the equation corresponds to every outcome
	of a statistical experiment with its probability of occurrence.
	
Types of Probability Distributions
Statisticians divide probability distributions into the following types:
i)Discrete Probability Distributions
ii)Continuous Probability Distributions

Types of Discrete Probability Distributions
1.Binomial distributions
2.Normal distributions
3.Poisson distributions

Types of Continuous Probability Distributions
i)Uniform distributions
ii)Cumulative probability distributions

2. Learn about PDF and CDF.
	PDF - Probability density function  and CDF - Cummulative distribution function
	The CDF is the probability that random variable values less than or equal to x 
	The PDF is a probability that a random variable, say X, will take a value exactly equal to x.
